# Pipeline Notes
## Deploy
1. Checkout repo
2. Template out gitconfig TODO: check on this
All the following are conditionals
3. Deploy Cluster Stack
Executes a template at templates/cdktf.yaml

- - - - - FEATURE THOUGHT:
Add feature to this script to commit and push to the blog repo.
__________END

4. Run Playbook
Executes a template at templates/ansible-playbook.yaml
5. Test Cluster
Executes a template at templates/test-cluster.yaml
6. Install Customer Tenants
Executes same templates/ansible-playbook.yaml, but with different values. I suspect the template contains just enough to choose an ansible playbook to run and pass it values.
7. Install Cluster DNS Utility
Same ansible-playbook.yam

---------------------------------
I need to figure out how I can articulate how much I actually dislike this process. I think my ideal would look more like:
# Cluster Creation
In a repo called something like `CostcoWholesale/ECP/aks-core` contain the cluster TF definitions (I _assume_ that tfcdk is fine there, but have no idea)
Ansible playbooks can probably be replaced with Helm Releases, templated right in terraform.

Related thought: the `install-tenants` bit probably adds a namespace to the cluster... Do we enforce attaching that to a repo or a directory within a repo to enforce IaC?

## Everything After
The more I think about it, the more I like the idea of a monorepo for customers to deploy their applications. The primary wrinkle there is the lack of ADO Repos support for CODEOWNERS, which would make us responsible for approving
every Pull-Request. And, more specifically, unless things change, make Jonathan approve every pull request.

If we are deadset on the multi-tenant clusters, the only way I see that working smoothly is with a monorepo. One question is: could it just be `ECP/aks`? Perhaps something like:
`/clusters/<env>/<tenant>/<namespace>/`

That is all assuming that the only current route for customers to use helm/kustomize/etc. is by setting up their own cluster.

# HERE IS WHY I DISLIKE THE CURRENT PROCESS
1. Any user with access to run a pipeline can modify what is _essentially_ production (think, would It be trouble if I accidentally blew away a customer's repo?)
Cluster creation should be protected by pull request. If we aren't going to make it hands-free (eg. run cluster.deploy) if cluster doesn't exist. We should at least require `cluster.*` pipelines be only run from `main`
I recognize the challenge of that is that it would be difficult to test changes, so having a separate `cluster.deploy_dev` makes sense.
